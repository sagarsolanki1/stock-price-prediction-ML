# stock-price-prediction-ML
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using machine learning techniques like LSTM, ARIMA, and SMA. It integrates Neptune for experiment tracking, visualizes stock trends, and evaluates model performance through metrics like RMSE and MAPE.

# Stock Analysis: Fundamental Analysis vs. Technical Analysis

When it comes to stocks, fundamental and technical analyses are at opposite ends of the market analysis spectrum.

# Fundamental Analysis
Fundamental analysis evaluates a company’s stock by examining its intrinsic value, including tangible assets, financial statements, management effectiveness, strategic initiatives, and consumer behaviors. It is a relevant indicator for long-term investment and relies on both historical and present data to measure revenues, assets, costs, liabilities, and more. Generally, the results from fundamental analysis don’t change with short-term news.

# Technical Analysis
Technical analysis analyzes measurable data from stock market activities, such as stock prices, historical returns, and volume of historical trades. It focuses on historical data and current data, primarily for short-term trading purposes. Due to its short-term nature, technical analysis results are easily influenced by news. Popular methodologies include moving averages (MA), support and resistance levels, and trend lines.

# Project Focus
In this project, we’ll be focusing on technical analysis using Simple MA and Exponential MA techniques to predict stock prices. We will also utilize LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), a deep learning framework for time-series data, to build a predictive model and compare its performance against our technical analysis.
