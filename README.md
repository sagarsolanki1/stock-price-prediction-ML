## 1. Stock Analysis: Fundamental vs. Technical Analysis
We explain the key differences between **Fundamental** and **Technical Analysis** and why technical analysis (using SMA, EMA) is chosen for this project.

---

## 2. Stock Prices as Time-Series Data
Understanding stock prices as time-series data and why it is essential for prediction models, including a brief on moving averages (MA).

---

## 3. Dataset Analysis
Analyzing **AAPL stock data (1999-2021)** retrieved from Alpha Vantage, explaining the **train-test split**, data cleaning, and pre-processing steps.

---

## 4. Creating a Neptune.ai Project
Set up a Neptune.ai project to track experiments, logs, and results, ensuring reproducibility and organized workflow.

---

## 5. Evaluation Metrics and Helper Functions
We use **RMSE** and **MAPE** to evaluate prediction accuracy, and helper functions are implemented for metric calculations and plotting.

---

## 6. Predicting Stock Price with Moving Average (MA)
Implementing SMA and EMA techniques to predict stock prices, with performance metrics logged to Neptune.

---

## 7. Introduction to LSTMs for Time-Series Data
LSTM deep learning model is introduced to improve accuracy for sequential time-series data.

---

## 8. Final Thoughts on New Methodologies
Discussion on future improvements and methodologies for stock price prediction.
